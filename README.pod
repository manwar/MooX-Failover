=head1 NAME

MooX::Failover - Instantiate Moo classes with failover

=head1 VERSION

v0.2.0_01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # In your class:

  package MyClass;

  use Moo;
  use MooX::Failover;

  has 'attr' => ( ... );

  # after attributes are defined:

  failover_to 'OtherClass';

  ...

  # When using the class

  my $obj = MyClass->new( %args );

  # If %args contains missing or invalid values or new otherwise
  # fails, then $obj will be of type "OtherClass".

=head1 RECENT CHANGES

=head2 Enhancements

=over 4

=item * 

Significant optimizations at the expense of incompatability.

=item * 

Added the ability to use an alternative name of the constructor for the failover class.

=item * 

Arguments for the constructor can be a hash reference, array reference

=back

=head2 Incompatability

=over 4

=item * 

Rewrote the interface entirely, so that the failover is specified as part of the class definition. See the POD for details.

=item * 

Added missing MANIFEST.SKIP and removed dist.ini from distribution.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides constructor failover for L<Moo> classes.

If a class cannot be instantiated because of invalid arguments
(perhaps from an untrusted source), then instead it returns the
failover class (passing the same arguments to that class).

This allows for cleaner design, by not forcing you to duplicate type
checking for class parameters.

Note that this is roughly equivalent to using

  my $obj = eval { MyClass->new(%args) //
     OtherClass->new( %args, error => $@ );

Note that your failover class should support the same methods as the
original class.  A use case for this role would be for instantiating
L<Web::Machine::Resource> objects, where the failover is a
Web::Machine::Resource object that returns an error page.

Ideally, your failover class would satisy the Liskov Substitution
Principle, so that (roughly) all provable properties of the original
class are also provable of the failover class.  In practice, we only
care about the properties (methods and attributes) that are actually
used in our programs.
